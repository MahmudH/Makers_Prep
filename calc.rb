#365 days in a year and each day is 24 hours, therefore 365 days multiplied by hours which is 24
puts 365 * 24

#365 days in 1 year, decade is 10 years, therfore 365 multiplied by 10 is the amount of days in a decade
#there are 60 minutes in 1 hour, and there are 24 hours in a day, therefore multiply amount of days with 24 and then times by 60 for minutes

# mintutes in one year including leap year
year_minutes = (365.25 * 24) * 60

puts "Hours in a year are: #{year_minutes}"

#decade is 10 years, year_minutes multiplied by 10 is minutes in a decade
 decade_minutes = year_minutes * 10

 puts "Minutes in a decade are: #{decade_minutes}"
